# Non-hydrostatic mesoscale model GRAMM<br>
Dispersion modelling in complex terrain and in situations with low wind speeds is still challenging. Nevertheless, air pollution has to be assessed in such environments.
It is therefore necessary to develop models and methods, which allow for such assessments with reasonable demands on computational times and with sensible accuracy.
This has been the motivation for the development of the non-hydrostatic mesoscale wind-field model GRAMM at the Graz University of Technology, Institute for Internal Combustion Engines and Thermodynamics, ever since 1999. <br>
Meanwhile the Governments of Tyrol (since 2014) and Styria (since 2006), Austria, are further developing the model. In 2019, the decision was made to publish GRAMM as Open Source.<br>

GRAMM solves the conservation equations for mass, momentum, enthalpy (potential temperature, specific humidity, and cloud water. The resulting three dimensional wind fields can be used as input for the Lagrangian particle model GRAL.<br>

We developed a powerful graphical user interface (GUI) to simplify the numerous input values, to display the results, and to enable checks of your model input and output. Also the GUI is free and completely published as Open Source.<br>
